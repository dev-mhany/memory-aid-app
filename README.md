# Memory Aid App

This is a **Memory Aid App** built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), designed to assist Alzheimer's patients and their families by providing tools for daily management, cognitive exercises, and information sharing. The app features memory games, daily task management, and patient profile management, aiming to make day-to-day life easier and more organized for patients and caregivers alike.

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, install the project dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Development Server

Next, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Project Overview

This application uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font. The site features a simple and intuitive interface designed to accommodate the needs of Alzheimer's patients and their families. Key features include:

- **Memory Games:** Interactive games designed to stimulate memory and cognitive function.
- **Patient Profile Management:** Securely manage patient details, including daily routines, important events, and more.
